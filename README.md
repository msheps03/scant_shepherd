# scant_shepherd

Fork of scAnt project available here: [scAnt](https://github.com/evo-biomech/scAnt)


Virtual environment that supports the use of FLIR blackfly camera and is utilized for the scanning of small objects and reassembling into a 3D mesh with photogrammetric reconstruction. Main differences between the repos is overhauling the stepper motor class, and taking steps to load the stepper configuration from the stepper motor instead of "random" declarations of values. Further, the UI had issues when scaling the project with parts that were not used in the original model. 

CAD models that were modified will be included at the end of May '23 when GRABCAD drops their workbench support.
